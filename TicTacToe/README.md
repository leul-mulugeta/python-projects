# Tic Tac Toe

The **Tic Tac Toe** game is a classic 3x3 grid game, implemented in Python. This project provides two versions of the game: one with a command-line interface (CLI) and the other with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Pygame. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on the grid with either 'X' or 'O' until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- Playable in both CLI and GUI versions.
- Simple and intuitive gameplay with two players.
- Detects winning conditions and draw situations.
- GUI version using Pygame for a visual experience.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library (for the GUI version)

### Pygame Installation
To install Pygame, run the following command:
```sh
pip install pygame
```
